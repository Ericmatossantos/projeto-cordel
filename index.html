            I wanna take you somewhere
            <br>
            so you know I care
            <br>
            But it’s so cold and I don’t know where
            <br>
            I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
            <br>
            But they won’t flower like they did last spring
            </p>

       <p>
        And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
<br>
I’m just so tired to share my nights
<br>
I wanna cry and I wanna love
<br>
But all my tears have been used up
       </p>

            On another love, another love
            <br>
            All my tears have been used up
            <br>
            On another love, another love
            <br>
            All my tears have been used up
            <br>
            On another love, another love
            <br>
            All my tears have been used up
            <br>
            And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
            <br>
            But my hands been broken one too many times
            <br>
            So I’ll use my voice, I’ll be so fucking rude
            <br>
            Words they always win, but I know I’ll lose
        </p>

            And I’d sing a song that’d be just ours
